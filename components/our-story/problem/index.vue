              p Medical record systems are highly fragmented, disorganized, and non-collaborative even in some developed countries. Many are still using legacy platforms and are not employing the latest available technologies. Some are exclusive and are not interoperable with other systems.
              p Thus health professionals are unable to optimize patient healthcare. In the same manner, patients have difficulty monitoring and organizing their medical data and history.
