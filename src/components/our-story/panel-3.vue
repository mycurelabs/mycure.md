              p It started with coffee â€” a late night coffee break between college friends, Dale and Joel, who just came from a wake.

                | is a marketing executive and has been involved in the field for the last 20 years. His work involves a lot of travel and he loves to explore and talk to local folks during these times.

He believes that there are still a lot that can be done and that a good tech infrastructure can be a big boost in improving this sector.
